# Run Log Repeat

Welcome to Run Log Repeat! This website is made to be an online journal for runners to log their runs. This is a front-end centered project, where details such as miles, time, and location can be posted for yourself and others to see.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. The database is running off a json server. Here is the link to it: https://github.com/Doubles-101/run-log-repeat-api
3. Run the server (I use `json-server database.json -p 8088` Make sure this is in a separate window or tab)
4. Run `npm run dev` (On the original window or tab you cloned this project)
5. Copy the link the terminal gives you and put it into your browser

### Prerequisites

Make sure to clone the repo and you are running the server from step 2.
